# 3DuF
Create molds for microfluidic devices using your FDM 3D Printer.

## Gather materials:
1. FDM 3D Printer -- We use the [Printrbot Simple Metal](http://printrbot.com/product-category/3d-printers/simple-metal/) beacuse it's cheap, hackable, and supports easy nozzle changes. We got ours from [Amazon](http://amzn.com/B00IYC60IM) and modded it with a [heated bed](http://printrbot.com/shop/simple-metal-heated-bed/), an [ATX power supply](http://printrbot.com/shop/atx-power-supply/), and a [.2mm nozzle](http://printrbot.com/shop/tip-6-pack/) to improve bed adhesion and device resolution, respectively.
2. Filament -- We use [Gizmodorks White PLA](http://amzn.com/B00FG7BR22), but any PLA filament should do.
3. Hairspray -- Used to get PLA to stick nicely to the glass slides. We use [Consort](http://amzn.com/B000052Y6I), but any alcohol-based spray will probably do. Water-based hairspray took a long time to evaporate and was less tacky afterwards, but YMMV.
4. 2x3" Glass slides -- We bought [a whole lot of these]( http://amzn.com/B00EP0RUZ4) so we wouldn't have to worry about running out. Anything around that size and 1-1.2mm thick should do.

## Get the software:

1. [Python](http://www.python.org/) -- For designing chips and placing primitives. I use 2.7, but 3.4 should also work.
2. [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) -- For rendering designs into 3D geometry. 
3. [Slic3r](http://www.slic3r.org/) -- For slicing 3D models into printer instructions.
4. [Octoprint](http://www.octoprint.org/) -- Optional, for running your 3D printer. 
5. Clone this repo onto your computer.
